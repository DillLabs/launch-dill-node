# Instructions

## Setting up your dill node

To set up your Dill node for the Alps testnet, follow these steps.

### Step 1: Download and Run the Dill Node Script

Open your terminal and execute the following command to launch a new Dill node or add a validator to an existing node:

```bash
curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DillLabs/launch-dill-node/main/dill.sh && chmod +x dill.sh && ./dill.sh
```

### Step 2: Select Your Node Type

After running the script, you will be prompted to choose between launching a new Dill node or adding a validator to an existing node.

```bash
Please choose an option for your purpose [1, Launch a new dill node, 2, Add a validator to existing node] [1]:
```

Choose `1` to launch a new node or `2` to add a validator.

### Step 3: Generating Validator Keys

Next, you will be prompted to generate your validator keys. You can either create a new mnemonic or use an existing one.

```bash
********** Step 3: Generating Validator Keys **********

Validator Keys are generated from a mnemonic
Please choose an option for mnemonic source [1, From a new mnemonic, 2, Use existing mnemonic] [1]:
```

- Choose `1` to generate a new mnemonic (ensure you save this securely).
- Choose `2` if you already have a mnemonic and wish to use it.

### Step 4: Setting Your Deposit Token Amount and Withdrawal Address

After generating your validator keys, you will be asked to select the deposit token amount for staking, and then to provide a withdrawal address.

1. **Choose a deposit token amount**:
   - Option `1`: 3600 DILL
   - Option `2`: 36000 DILL

```bash
Please choose an option for deposit token amount [1, 3600, 2, 36000] [1]: 1
```

2. **Enter your withdrawal address**:

You will be prompted to enter the Ethereum (Eth1) address where you would like your rewards to be sent.

```bash
Please enter your withdrawal address: 
```

3. **Warning**: Ensure the address is correct, and that you have control over it. If you use an Eth1 address, you will see this warning:

```bash
**[Warning] you are setting an Eth1 address as your withdrawal address. Please ensure that you have control over this address.**
```

4. **Repeat the withdrawal address** for confirmation:

```bash
Repeat your withdrawal address for confirmation:
```

After launching successfully, you should see an output like this:

```
Checking if the node is up and running...
node running, congratulations ðŸ˜„
```
